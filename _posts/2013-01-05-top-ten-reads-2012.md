title: Top Ten Reads of 2012.
---

In light of new traditions, I thought I'd make a second list this year.  Of top ten, notable reads, of any form.  Since this is on a whim, and I haven't been thinking about it year long, I'm not super confident in these choices.  However, I'll be making this list for 2013 and will be thinking about it year along the way.

* 10) The Hunger Games Trilogy - Suzanne Collins

	* I know, you guys. I was way late to this, just in time for the movies.  HOWEVER. The trilogy consumed ten days of my life this year, reading each novel cover to cover sacrificing sleep.  I consumed them. A must on this list. NO SHAME.

* 9) Design is a job - Mike Monteiro

	![Design is a job](/img/post-assets/2013-1-5/covers/design-is-a-job.jpeg)

	* As someone who doesn't fall into the intended target audience for this book (freelance designer), I was surprised and delighted by how strongly it resonated with me.  The lessons learned and subsequent strategy taught for working with others contained powerful generalizations anyone could take back to work with them.  I literally got a sunburn reading this 135 page book on a deceivingly sun-hot San Francisco afternoon... and y'know what? It was worth it.

* 8) The Shape of Design - Frank Chimero

	* I backed the kickstarter on this one, and was delighted to receive it just in time for a weekend in Palm Springs with friends.  I spent the hot weekend pouring over each page, and was mostly delighted with Mr. Chimero's stories & experience, over the essay/thesis-esque dialect.  Looking fwd to learning more from his experience in future pieces.

* 7) Lena Dunham's New Yorker piece

	* So we were definitely late to the HBO Girls bandwagon. In fact, we basically had to take a plane to catch up with it (quite literally, we ended up catching up on a plane).  So when I read [this piece](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/08/13/120813fa_fact_dunham) in the New Yorker, I honestly didn't really know who Lena Dunham was.  Which I think makes her talent as a writer even more showing. I quickly finished the piece, then read it again, then started furiously googling. Since reading the article I've let Girls fill the void that this article left behind, but looking forward to [even more](http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/lena-dunham-sings-book-deal-for-more-than-3-5-million/) raw comedic writing from Miss Dunham in 2013. 

* 6) Kinfolk Magazine - A collection of wonderfully talented writers

	![Kinfolk Magazine](/img/post-assets/2013-1-5/covers/kinfolk.png)

	* [Jeff](http://www.jeffroche.me) gave me issue four of Kinfolk for my birthday in August, and it was honestly the first time I'd heard of it.  It's equal parts non-mythical Portland forest hipster pixie porn, and plain old amazing content relevent to all things we both love.  All content is centered around the joys of small gatherings, whether for One, Two or Many.  I welcome each new issue with excitement, and have taken more from these magazines than many others I've dabbled with over the years combined. The most recent holiday issue is my favorite to date, with a collecton of short pieces on cherished time with family and friends.

* 5) Unfamiliar Fishes - Sarah Vowell

	![Unfamiliar Fishes](/img/post-assets/2013-1-5/covers/unfamiiar-fishes.png)

	* I received Unfamiliar Fishes as a gift last Christmas, with the intent that we'd take a trip to Hawaii this year and this book would be an excellent precursor. One seat sale turned into another and we ended up going to Japan, but I'm thrilled I read this book regardless.  Although the attention to Hawaiian history was the motive for purchasing, Vowell's comedic writing style in balance with the former is what makes this such a killer book.

* 4) Where'd you go Bernadette - Maria Semple

	![Bernadette](/img/post-assets/2013-1-5/covers/bernadette.png)

	* One of my favorites this year, I read this cover to cover over the course of a weekend incapable of putting it down. Semple, screenwriter of some of my favorite things, a la Saturday Night Live & Arrested Development, delivers an amazing story about many things but at its real core family.  By the end, Bernadette, Elgin & daughter Bee feel like old friends, each character developed at its own pace throughout the novel.

* 3) Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore - Robin Sloan

	![Penumbra](/img/post-assets/2013-1-5/covers/penumbra.png)

	* This was the 2012 book for the San Francisco tech nerd.  I mean, it's so good everyone should read it.  But from the first page I related more to this book personally than any other piece of fiction I've ever read.  It's a mystery novel, set in modern (future) day San Francisco.  It's an absolute must read.  

* 2) Savage Detectives - Roberto Bolano

	![Savage Detectives](/img/post-assets/2013-1-5/covers/savage-detectives.png)

	* [Jeff](http://www.jeffroche.me) is a huge Bolano fan and had been encouraging me to read Savage Detectives for the past three years.  I finally caved and dug in right at the beginning of the year, and was captivated with the characters of Bolano's craft.  The sheer amount of characters, and time which passes throughout the novel set in Mexico requires a steady eye, and often re-reading previous sections. But time and patience is rewarded here. 

* 1) Super Sad True Love Story - Gary Shteyngart

	![Super sad true love story](/img/post-assets/2013-1-5/covers/super-sad-true-love-story.png)

	* I can't put into words how amazing this book is/how much I think about it.  So I think that's all I'll say.  I finished it and picked up Shteyngart's other piece, Absurdistan, which I also enjoyed. But nothing came close to having the effect on me Super Sad True Love Story did in 2012.  Comedic, and portraying a future US very eerily realistic.
