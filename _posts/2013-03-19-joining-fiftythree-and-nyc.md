title: Joining FiftyThree.
---

I couldn't be more excited to share that I'm joining <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/" target="_blank">FiftyThree</a>, on their incredible engineering team. 

When I decided I was ready to try something new, I looked to my absolute favorite products and companies for inspiration. I've been a huge fan of FiftyThree since they released their first product, <a href="http://goo.gl/8Zz1n" target="_blank">Paper</a>, back in March of last year, and have watched with awe as they have continued to deliver perfect <a href="http://goo.gl/aIh8D" target="_blank">update</a> after <a href="http://goo.gl/eHt2V" target="_blank">update</a>. This hasn't gone unnoticed, with FiftyThree winning a bunch of huge awards last year: Apple Design Award, Apple iPad App of the Year, Crunchie for best design, amongst others.

I'll be based out of their Tribeca office in NYC, which means I'll also be making the move from SF back to my home coast: the east coast.  I'm equally excited to be joining the <a href="http://goo.gl/GwmI4" target="_blank">NYC tech scene</a>, and can't wait to meet the community.

The <a href="http://goo.gl/hP9Q9" target="_blank">team at FiftyThree is world class</a>, and I can't wait to start working with them. They are quite simply changing the way people create in the post-PC era.  

We're going to be making some pretty incredible things together, and I can't wait to share more.

❤ ❤ ❤

Aside: I've been using Paper for my own personal side project of <a href="http://tarajanedrawswithpaper.tumblr.com" target="_blank">documenting movies I watch</a>.
