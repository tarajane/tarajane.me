title: Today is my last day at Adobe.
---

I started with Adobe on January 2, 2006 as an intern.  I had landed my dream job on my first college internship thanks to an engineering manager at Adobe Ottawa who decided to take a chance on an excited and enthusiastic engineering student whose experience at that point consisted merely of high school, macromedia flash, side projects.  [I've been with Adobe since](/resume.html). 

To say it's been a blast would be an understatement.  I've had the opportunity to work on so many different amazing projects, with the past two years being particularly rewarding with [Adobe Edge Reflow](http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow/) launching and getting to speak at Adobe's [Create the Web](http://goo.gl/ers8q) event on the same stage Steve Jobs once occupied to host Apple product launch events.

When asked what my favorite thing about working at Adobe is, my answer has always been without hesitation: the people. 
Thank you to each and every one of my coworkers for making the last seven years so incredible.

I'm beyond excited about what's next, and can't wait to share soon.

For now I'm enjoying my first, last day of work: thanks Adobe.
