title: Something new before the end of the year.
---

I typically consider December to be a month of reflection of my past year leading up to New Years.  This includes compiling lists of favorites, scrambling to prepare for the holidays, and travelling home to Newfoundland.

I thought I'd try and squeeze in one more new thing before we call 2012 a wrap: this blog.

I'm still trying to decide what exactly I'd like to use this space for, but I'm thinking the next few weeks will shape that.
